HOW TO USE NEWSLIFY:
Firstly you need an api key, open your browser and type www.newsapi.org
Create an account and generate an api key as well.
Secondly, I assume you have android studio already.. so unzip the file, open it from android studio and allow it to build.
 After the building is done, you should head over to com/crushtech/newslify/ui/util/Constants.kt you will see email, replace the text with your email, you can replace the privacy policy as well, then next the api key , replace the api key with the one gotten from your news api account.
 That’s all.. enjoy the app, you can tweak it to your taste.

Incase of any problems please don’t hesitate to contact me via email at xplendo@gmail.com or Instagram at dremo.dev.
Happy coding…
